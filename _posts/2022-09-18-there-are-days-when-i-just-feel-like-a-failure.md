This ability of mine can make me switch from the happiest person on earth to the most depressed and self-pitying prick faster than the downfall of the Philippine economy. I usually think rationally (and positively). But there are just days when I feel I'm not doing enough/I'm not enough.

But this feeling will pass.. as it always does.
