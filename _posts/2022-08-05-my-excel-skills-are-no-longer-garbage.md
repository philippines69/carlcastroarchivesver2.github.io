I've made considerable progress since my last post (can be found [here](https://www.carlcastroarchives.ml/started-learning-some-excel/)). I still ain't good by any means, but at least I've improved a little.

I'm following the [Excel Basics Free Course by ExcelIsFun](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrRPvpgDmw0n34OMHeS94epMaX_Y8Tu1k). I didn't know it'd be difficult to learn. After this, I'm hoping to start learning Quickbooks or something similar.
