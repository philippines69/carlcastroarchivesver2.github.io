In all my years, never once have I witnessed the passing of a close relative. Was I just lucky? Maybe. That was the case for me, until 2022. _(mass shootings, COVID,_ [_Sana_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsUj0dszADCGbF3gNrQEuSQ)_'s graduation, and now you're telling me another relative's dead?)_ Been a rough year.

Another person very dear to me has left. After hearing the news, all my worries felt meaningless in an instant. It felt like this year has been so bad worldwide that my problems felt so.. _small_. üíÄ

Life's so fragile. There's always a chance that something negatively life-changing might happen, screwing up everything you've been building your entire life.

Maybe there's a good reason why this quote is so worn out. Maybe all those 'motivational speakers' were right and maybe they were onto something.
