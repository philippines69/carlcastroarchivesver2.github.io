# Choosing to Morb

Last night, I was faced with a predicament: picking a good movie to play on the TV. Tons of western films to choose from! So I narrowed down my picks and scanned Marvel's growing lineup of films.

Aaaand I chose **Morbius**. Why? Cause I thought it'd be funnyðŸ˜‚

Of all the Marvel movies, I'd say Morbius is definitely one of them. The runtime of 1 hour and 44 minutes simply wasn't enough. But I GUESS it's fine as long as they're working on a sequel.

# Well Carl, how was it?

Boring. Pretty sh*t. Go watch it.
