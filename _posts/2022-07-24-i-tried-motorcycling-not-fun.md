# I live in

I live in a third-world country. Motorcycles are the go-to vehicles here. They're:

1. Cheap
2. Less traffic pain

And so I tried learning to ride one. I was commuting to uni before this, so I decided I would finally recover some of my sanity by saying _goodbye_ to all the packed jeepneys.

That was the plan, anyway. Never thought it'd be challenging. They always say "it's just like riding a bicycle." It did NOT feel like riding a bicycle. Controlling the throttle was one thing, now I have to learn 700 different bits and pieces just to 'familiarize' how the whole thing works. Nah fam, I don't think I will.

But anyway, I'll probably do alright.
