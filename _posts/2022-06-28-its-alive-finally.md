I've been working on this site for months now. And honestly? Installing [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) was a colossal pain in the butt. Take note, my experience with web development was virtually ZERO before this, so you can imagine the amount of head-scratching before I could even get it up and running.

But hey, you're reading this right now, so I guess it all worked out in the end!

Don't get me wrong; this was a great learning experience. I learned a lot of [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css), [**HTML**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and some [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript). Maybe I should scrap my plans of becoming an engineer and transition into web dev instead!

_I'll make a post on the process it took to launch this blog. It'll come out Soon Enough Probably_â„¢
