So I just realized that I've been observing how people behave and react in different situations and at different times. It's pretty damn interesting seeing how the inner mechanisms of the brain work based on their demeanor towards people/scenarios/themselves.

Now, I realized that taking a degree in Psychology might be something that would satiate my curiosity about the human mind. The problem is, I'm already on an Engineering course, which is arguably more profitable than taking psychology. So maybe I'll let this stay on the sidelines for a bit and see where my engineering course will take me.
