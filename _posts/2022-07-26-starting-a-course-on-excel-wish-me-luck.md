# Getting good

Starting today, I'll be learning some skills that'd probably be helpful in the long run. First thing on the list is learning Excel. I'm familiar with it, I just need to do a proper run-through to prime my skills.

I'll mainly be learning from these sources:

* [Excel Practice Online](https://excel-practice-online.com/functions/excel_basics/)
* [ExcelIsFun Basics Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrRPvpgDmw0n34OMHeS94epMaX_Y8Tu1k)

Wish me luck!ðŸ’ª
