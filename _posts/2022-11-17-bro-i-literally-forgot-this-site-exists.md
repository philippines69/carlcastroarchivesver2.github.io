### Guess who's back?

Man, a LOT happened last month. Now I feel like a completely different person. Heck, even my previous post about psychology didn't look like it was made by me.

Anyways, I'm broke-ass right now, so I've started sending more proposals hoping to land an okay-ish gig. I (yet again) did another rework of my Upwork and OLJ profiles as the previous ones were too shitty (and messy) even for my standards.

I'll probably go back to being semi-active on this site, college sucks way too much of my time and brain cells.

Wish me luck I guess?
