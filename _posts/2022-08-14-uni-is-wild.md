Just started university. Hooray!ðŸ¥³

These last few weeks have been wild. I started gymming, started uni, and now Iâ€™m typing this out with notes and highlighters on my desk. Is my life finally changing for the better?

The scheduleâ€™s tight, and Iâ€™m still adjusting to my new environment. I made quite a few new friends; some came from different schools, and others even from nearby provinces. Itâ€™s been quite exciting.
