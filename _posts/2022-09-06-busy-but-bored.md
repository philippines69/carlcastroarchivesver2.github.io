# Busy-bored??

Quite a weird feeling, really. One day you’re bored, but then the next day, you’d be doing stuff for hours on end.

They say boredom is necessary to let our minds reflect and wander. That might be true in some cases, but to me, boredom feels soo ‘unproductive.’ So it only induces more anxiety than anything else.

Anyways, I’ve been busy-bored these past few weeks that I couldn’t work on other stuff. Good thing I was recently able to catch a break, and now I have ample time to work on my side projects (only for a day of course).

# Epic medieval ambience

Yesterday I discovered these “medieval music” compilations on my recommendation and thought the thumbnails looked cool, so I clicked on them. I’m not really into ASMR but this one’s quite good (dunno if this counts as ASMR though; some videos include “ASMR Ambience” in the title so yeah).
