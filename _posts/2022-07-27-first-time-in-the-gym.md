My first ever gym experience was _different_.

A fit dude approached me immediately after filling out the form. I guess he's my instructor now?? You'd usually pay them to help you out, but he says it's free so I guess that's that.

He showed me the ropes and taught me how to use the equipment. There were lots of equipment to get around, surprisingly enough. The membership fee was so cheap I thought it'd be a rundown gym with incomplete equipment.

Anyways, one key takeaway I can get from this is that I'm so WEAK. But, even pros come from humble beginnings, right? So I guess I should just power through this.

Let's see where this'll take me and hopefully my P300 membership fee won't go to waste
